Initialize 'ref' with all zeros. This op requires that the tensor is not
initialized. The tensor will first be allocated memory, then be filled with all
zeros. This op is intended to save memory during initialization,
if you use this op, you should not run initializer of the 'ref' tensor.

ref: Should be from a `Variable` node.
